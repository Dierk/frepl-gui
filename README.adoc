For users
=========

Download the distribution zip (20 MB) from
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/71750979/Frege/frepl-0.6.0.zip .

Unpack to an `<install-dir>` of your choice.

With a Java 8 (u40 or higher), run

    <install-dir>/bin/frepl

Additions to the use of the command-line REPL
=============================================
In addition to the commands in the command-line REPL like `:help`, you can press Ctrl-I (Mac: Cmd-I) to see an info screen
with all available shortcuts and commands.

The "history" list is pre-populated with commands that you may want to try out.

* `:l http:...` to load a script from URL
* `:browse Stairs` to see what's in the _Stairs_ module
* `play ...` for graphical output

Please note that _this GUI is not an IDE_. The content of the editor is fed line-by-line to the
command-line REPL and this limits the amount of work that one can do in "one go".

Multi-line content is automatically wrapped in `:{` and `:}` as expected by the REPL.

However, that still doesn't allow to submit multi-line definitions together with their usage:

    foo a b =
              a * b
    foo 1 2          -- will fail with "a where clause cannot start with '=' "

What works is to do the same in two steps.

Step 1

    foo a b =
              a * b

Step 2

    foo 1 2

That is something to keep in mind when copy-pasting code in the editor.

More to note
============

Output is *truncated* to 80 characters. That means that you can even safely evaluate infinite sequences like `[1..]`.
However, this comes at the expense of only seeing the first 80 digits when evaluating numbers that are
greater than 10e80.

When code yields unexpected results or you get error messages that you do not understand, you many want
to *reset* the state of the REPL with `:reset` and try again.

When filing *issues*, please run the `:history` command and attach the output to your issue such that we can
reproduce the behavior.

For developers only
===================

*Really, this is only for developers that would like to contribute (much appreciated).*
Normal users please use the download link at the top of this page.

[NOTE]
Since version 0.6, FregeFX is an external dependency that you might need to `gradlew install` (`./gradlew install` on linux and macos)
locally if a SNAPSHOT version is referenced.


With Java 8 (update 40 or higher) start via

    gradlew clean run


NOTE: There is no need to install gradle or anything else beside a Java 8 JDK.
      It is all self-installing.

==For users

Download the [distribution zip](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/71750979/Frege/client-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.zip).
Unpack to an `<install-dir>` of your choice.

With a Java 8, run

    <install-dir>/bin/client

==For developers

With Java 8 start via

    gradlew clean :client:run


NOTE: There is no need to install gradle or anything else beside a Java 8 JDK.
      It is all self-installing.


CAUTION: For the latest state of development, there is an issue with the dependency to
the `frege-repl` project that needs local `maven install` since it is not available
in any public repository, yet.
This in turn depends on `frege-interpreter`, that also needs be built locally with `maven install`.
Once we get to a release candidate, this will all be resolved through final versions in a public repo.
